                   crimes are linked to mental health.
According to the Australian Institute of Criminology,
those who are battling mental health are more inclined to commit injustice and illegal acts. 
In retribution, they develop four times more of a chance in encountering a mental health disorder, 
then one in public. 
Though many may argue that others classify one who's committed a crime to have a mental illness or dissorder, 
police officers detain one out of two that have a history of a mental illness/disorders, 
and the majority of the time will develop an illness or disorder after the legal system process.
